<center><h1>Welcome to the pool at Forest Park !</h1> </center>


		<h4>Thank you for your patience.</h4>
<p>
Things will be a little bit different this summer. We will have a 
Signup Genius with 2 hour time slots allowing a total of no more than 20 people in the pool.
We ask that each family only take one 2 hr. slot per day, however if you are at the pool and the following slot is available when your time is up you may sign up for that one too. Only sign up 
people that actually enter the pool.
</p>
<p>There will be <strong>no Lifeguard On Duty</strong> and all children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult who monitors the pool.  </p>
<p>All members must wear a mask upon entering the facilities and maintain their distance once inside. Mask policy will be monitored and enforced. 
Masks may be removed while social distancing at 6 feet on the lawn or in the pool. If you need to use the restroom put on your mask.
Both front and back Lanai's are closed and all chairs and lounges are currently unavailable. </p>
<p> Entry to the facility will be through the front door and exit through the rear gate only.
 There will be a 15 minute break in between each 2hr session to allow for cleaning of bathrooms and for the changeover to take place.
